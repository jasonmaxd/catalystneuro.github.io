      With the new NIH data sharing policies, many labs are now faced with a new challenge of standardizing and publishing the data from their experiments. For maximum compliance and reusability, we recommend the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard and the DANDI Archive. Using NWB is fully compatible with DANDI, ensures that all data is stored with sufficient metadata for reanalysis, and allows your data to be part of a large ecosystem of analysis and visualization tools and platforms that facilitate reuse.

      If you would like help converting data to NWB, we recommend you consult the NWB conversion guide. You are also encouraged to schedule a free consultation with our team so we determine how you might be able to use NeuroConv and other open source tools. 

      CatalystNeuro provides services to build custom conversion pipelines, which generally costs somewhere between $20,000 and $40,000, depending on the sophistication of the conversion and level of development required.
