[DANDI](https://www.dandiarchive.org/) is a BRAIN-funded project to build an archive for publicly sharing cellular neurophysiology data collected by the BRAIN Initiative. Our role in the project is to build support for NWB files, and to help the DANDI team reach out to NWB users to build a library of data. https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000055/draft
