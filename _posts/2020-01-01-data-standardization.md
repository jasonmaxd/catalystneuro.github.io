This pilot project with the Simons Foundation is aimed at helping labs adopt NWB while building and publicly releasing tools that will help other labs with the transition. This initial pilot included:
- hippocampal recordings in NHPs from Beth Buffalo’s lab
- Neuropixel recordings from Lisa Giocomo’s lab
- Volumetric calcium imaging of a fruit fly from Richard Axel’s lab.

Through this project we have been working with the CaImAn development team to support reading and writing NWB 2.0 files.

In year two, we are working with:
- Elizabeth Buffalo’s lab to develop a [Django-based database and web UI](https://github.com/catalystneuro/buffalo_db/tree/master) for experimental records based on IBL’s alyx.
- IBL to build conversion script from their internal data formats to NWB
- The Tank and Brody Labs to build a modular analysis and conversion pipeline for Neuropixel data using [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
