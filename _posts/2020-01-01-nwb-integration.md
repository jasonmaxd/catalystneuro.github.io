CatalystNeuro converted whole-day ECoG and behavioral recordings associated with the manuscript “Behavioral and Neural Variability of Naturalistic Arm Movements” ([https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.047357v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.047357v2)) to Neurodata Without Borders. We assisted in the publication of this data on DANDI, and publicly released the conversion code and some example code for accessing the data from NWB. We also provided interactive visualizations that allow data users to explore the data in the published NWB files.
