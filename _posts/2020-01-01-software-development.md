CatalystNeuro built infrastructure around the existing lab records database to make this data more easily integrated into the lab’s workflow. CatalystNeuro, collaborating with [Monadical](https://monadical.com/), together provided expertise in neural data management and software engineering and delivering the following services: support and maintenance of existing database; migration from excel files into the database; a query “cookbook” in MATLAB that connects directly to the database and illustrates queries for a number of different practical queries; and a dashboard for visualization of the records data.
