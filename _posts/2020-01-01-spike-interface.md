CatalystNeuro provides software development services is creating a unified and standardized platform for spike sorting, based on SpikeInterface, that integrates available open-source projects to facilitate the availability and usage of the latest technologies to neuroscience end-users. We provide a universal layer enabling comparison and easy exchanging of individual components of the extracellular electrophysiology data processing pipeline. This project aims at improving the SpikeInterface framework to better meet the needs of the neuroscience community and, in particular, Neuropixels users.
