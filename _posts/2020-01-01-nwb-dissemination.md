The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has been recently awarded a Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative U24 grant from National Institute of Health for dissemination of the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard for neurophysiology data to the neuroscience community over the next five (5) years. 

CatalystNeuroâ€™s role is to work on plans for managing NWB expansion and modification, partner selection and prioritization, and sustainability, including community-driven processes for integration of new neuroscience technologies and data types with NWB, a user selection and prioritization plan, and a sustainability roadmap. The CatalystNeuro team also conducts optimization and standardization activities, including user support, tutorial coverage, and test coverage; conducts outreach activities, including tutorials and workshops; and overall dissemination of NWB.
