We worked with the cutting edge Neuropixel dataset being released by the Allen Institute, as well as state-of-the-art visualization tools from Kitware to provide users with interactive visualization to explore neural data. Our visualization focused on different visual techniques to capture hierarchical structure in the design of the experiment. These visualizations have been added to the [NWBWidgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets) library for general use by the NWB community.
