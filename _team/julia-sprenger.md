bio: |
  Julia Sprenger has a BSc and MSc in physics from the RWTH Aachen University. During her master thesis and PhD at the JÃ¼lich Research Centre, she investigated spike-LFP relations using massively parallel extracellular electrophysiology recordings and related artefacts as well as data and metadata organization for the generation of FAIR electrophysiology datasets. She is the author of the odMLtables package for simplified metadata collection. She is currently a research engineer at the Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone in Marseille where she works on the development and implementation of data and metadata standards for electrophysiology datasets. She is co-leading the BIDS Extension Proposal 032 for animal electrophysiology and is a maintainer of the Neo package for electrophysiology data representation and conversion.
