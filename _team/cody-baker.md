name: "Cody Baker, Ph.D."
role: Senior Neurodata Scientist
bio: Cody earned his PhD in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics (ACMS) at the University of Notre Dame while working in the [Rosenbaum Group](https://www3.nd.edu/~rrosenb1/ndcnd.html) for Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience. His thesis focused on inference problems for second-order moments of activity in biological neural networks, including spike-time correlations, balance regimes, and synaptic structure. In particular, his primary interests focus on information processing and flow through biophysical neural models, which can eventually allow a thorough understanding of high-level cognitive function.
