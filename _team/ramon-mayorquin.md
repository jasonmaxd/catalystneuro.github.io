name: "Ramón Mayorquin, Ph.D."
role: Neurodata Scientist
bio: Ramón Heberto Martinez Mayorquin has a BSC in Physics and an MSc in Complexity Science and a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience. During his Ph.D., he studied in the theoretical and computational study of associative neural networks (e.g. Hopfield Network). During his studies, he has developed an interest in software practices that assure efficient, reproducible, and robust scientific simulations. This, together with his love for statistics and data wrangling has led him to move forward with a career in data science where he can combine and further develop those interests.
