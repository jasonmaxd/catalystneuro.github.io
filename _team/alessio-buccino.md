name: "Alessio Buccino, Ph.D."
role: Lead Neurodata Scientist
bio: Alessio Buccino has a BSc and MSc in biomedical engineering and an MSc in computer science. During his PhD at the University of Oslo, he explored the use of advanced modeling techniques and engineering solution to improve the state-of-the-art methods in extracellular electrophysiology for high-density neural probes, from spike sorting to selective electrical stimulation. Alessio is the lead architect of the SpikeInterface platform. He is currently a Postdoc at ETH and he is working on combining multiple recording modalities to build accurate and better validated single neuron models.
